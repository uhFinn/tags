./Tags/PlayerData/ is Tags primary storage method for storing a players active tag,
In this directory a file is created for each player, don't worry however as these
files will most likely be in the region of 20 bytes each, this means you could store
over 50,000 people before using even a megabyte of storage! (on average)

If you have any questions regarding the storage system don't hesitate to ask,
